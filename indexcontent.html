   <li>Filming next week:<ul>
    <li>For your scripts for filming, we will be filming 30 second pitch segments covering an introduction, problem solved, and how value was added. An example could be:</li>
	<li>Sherry: Our names our Sherry,</li>
	<li>Madan: Madan,</li>
	<li>Joel: and Joel.</li>
	<li>Sherry: I find watering plants to be quite a chore,</li>
	<li>Madan: and so we said how about we create an automatic plant watering system, especially given that people like to have plants but are increasingly busy which limits their opportunity to care for them.</li>
	<li>Joel: We took a look at existing solutions and saw that we could improve the _________ aspect of them.</li>
	<li>Sherry: I was able to boost the project by provisioning an internet connected database.</li>
	<li>Madan: In my case I really added value with my web skills.</li>
	<li>Joel: For me it was via the app creation.</li>
	<li>Grading:</li>

   <li>The section you attend, are registered in, and are a group member in, must match.</li>
   <li>Introduction to the course outline/blackboard/this site, two main objectives: your project (hardware with enterprise wireless, mobile application, database with web interface) and the matching <a href="https://www.oacett.org/downloads/get_certified/technology_report/Technology_Report_Guidelines.pdf">Technical Report</a>.</li> 
   <li>Regarding project choice, students typically proceed with the hardware and mobile application from the prerequisite courses. I am, however, looking for students interested in contributing to an applied research project with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c5pfFmr08Q">Crystal Fountains</a>.</li>
   <li>Markdown: <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Web-Development-tutorials/Up-Running-Markdown/438888-2.html">Tutorial</a>.</li>
   <li>References: <a href="http://library.humber.ca/help/apa">APA format</a></li>
   <li>Relevant technical references: visit <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/advsearch.jsp">IEEE's advanced search</a> click on “My Subscribed Content” from on campus, and type your search terms e.g. “iot market” into the search field.</li>
   <li>For next week: your group or you individually must choose the project's github site (belonging to student A), take your proposal and port it into Markdown, print it to a pdf saved in the repository and hand me (within the first fifteen mininutes of next class) the two relevant pages printed out, the one with the inline citations and one with the references list (/5).</li>
   <li>Having each part of the project present every week (including hardware) is required and forms a portion of that week's deliverable's grade.</li>

   <p><ul>
    <li>Solder together a sensor hat (parts provided from J206) for a Raspberry Pi 3 (that you purchase). This Broadcom development platform was chosen for a number of reasons. Let us start with platform requirements, it should be able to be used to create a small programmable device capable of connecting to enterprise Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and I2C. The NXP HCS12 can have a network stack loaded on it, but then not be able to do much more and thus the device would require multiple HCS12s for this purpose causing an increase in cost. Likewise with Atmel based Arduinos, connecting them to enterprise Wi-Fi is not straighforward. TI's beaglebone shows promise as an alternative however you would need to redesign the sensor hat in order to be compatible.</li>
	<li>Kits of sensor hat parts should be available in J206 (hours posted outside the door) to get started before the term starts if you like.</li>
	<li>Here are some videos on soldering: <a 
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfXXRfRIzY&list=PLQ32vZrF5U2lFOJTtZDytBWBYVLNp4RYz">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfXXRfRIzY&list=PLQ32vZrF5U2lFOJTtZDytBWBYVLNp4RYz</a> be sure to get Kelly and Vlad’s input on how to solder safely in J206.</li>
	<li>I have my Pi 3 in this case <a href="http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html">http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html</a> and we bought USB network adaptors from Tiger Direct. Note that USB webcams are more economical and robust than pi specific ones. Paul Moggach's Raspberry Pi Technical Notes which give some idea of how to use the network adaptor and more extensive programming examples, than the simple program that should blink the (red-green) LED that I emailed, are available via login on the Prototype Lab BlackBoard site.</li>
	<li>There is also a guide to buying a Raspberry Pi as part of <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Raspberry-Pi-tutorials/Up-Running-Raspberry-Pi/191267-2.html">https://www.lynda.com/Raspberry-Pi-tutorials/Up-Running-Raspberry-Pi/191267-2.html</a></li>
